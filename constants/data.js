This is where I began delivering visual content and automated data in order to track operation performances. At this point I also realized that I really enjoy creating digital products and processes, and helping people to develop their concepts and ideas.`,
      `I've been coding in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Motoko programming languages, to name a few.`,
